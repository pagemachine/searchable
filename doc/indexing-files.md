# File Indexing

Elasticsearch can index file content via ingest attachment plugin.

You need to install the plugin (see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/ingest-attachment.html)) and also create a pipeline configuration in your `ext_localconf.php`:

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['searchable']['pipelines'] = [
    'attachment' => [
        'description' => 'Extract attachment information from arrays',
        'processors' => [
            [
                'foreach' => [
                    'field' => 'attachments',
                    'processor' => [
                        'attachment' => [
                            'target_field' => '_ingest._value.attachment',
                            'field' => '_ingest._value.data',
                            'indexed_chars' => -1
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ],
            [
                'foreach' => [
                    'field' => 'attachments',
                    'processor' => [
                        'remove' => [ 'field' => '_ingest._value.data']
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

The pipeline itself is created within the `searchable:setup` command, so run it after configuring.

This pipeline does two things:

 * Extract binary file data from the *data* field to the *attachments* field (first foreach processor)

 * Remove the original binary to save disk space (second foreach processor)

Now you can set up the file indexer configuration:
```php
// Define indexer for files
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['searchable']['indexers']['files'] = [
    'className' => \PAGEmachine\Searchable\Indexer\FileIndexer::class,
    'config' => [
        'collector' => [
            'config' => [
                'fields' => [
                    'title',
                    'description',
                    'file'
                ],
            ]
        ],
        //...
    ]
];
```
By default the `FileLinkBuilder` is already set and good to go, so you just need to define preview rendering and features like as usual.
